## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Meet Ada May!
Iâ€™m currently earning a Bachelors in Computer Science from [Gratz College](https://www.gratz.edu/) through [Maalot Online](https://maalot.nevey.org/). Since a young age, I loved to play around with computers and experiment. I am a fast at catching on to new things, and I love to learn!
